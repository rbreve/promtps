# One shot prompts

To really compare different LLM models and how they generate the code and the quality of the out put I am creating mini games and comparare them, I will show you the preview of each one and the videos.

## Minigolf

``` create a slingshot like mechanic for launching a ball, create a random terrain, inside a hole, if when the ball hits the hall it restarts again, like a golf sling shot game, using js/html, make two walls in the left and right side of screen so the ball can bounce ```
